01) Destructors are called automatically after the scope of the object ends, whenever it may be.

02) No, as long as your program isn't dinamically allocating memory there's no need to create a
destructor manually. If a constructor is not declared/defined the compiler will assign one automatically.

03) Destructors are used to release the memory allocated by the object once they're of no use or their
 scopes end.
